### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

<p align="justify">My name is Juan Pablo Zorrilla. I'm an economist and I have a passion for data science, agile principles and lifelong learning. In the same way as this personal GitHub, I am permanently in construction by means of learning new things. Apart from learning code for improve machine learning models, I also maintain a blog - you can find my articles at [El Analista EconÃ³mico-Financiero](https://elanalistaeconomicofinanciero.blogspot.com/)</p>
