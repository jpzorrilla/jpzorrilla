### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Juan Pablo Zorrilla. I'm an economist and I have a passion for data science, agile principles and lifelong learning.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning code with data for improving explainability in machine learning models. But in my free time I also maintain a blog - you can find my articles at [El Analista EconÃ³mico-Financiero](https://elanalistaeconomicofinanciero.blogspot.com/)
